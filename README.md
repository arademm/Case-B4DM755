## Scenario
Occasionally, the law enforcement agency I work for receives "intelligence reports" about different cases. A trusted informant, who has connections to an international crime syndicate, contacted my supervisor about William S. McClean from Case #B4DM755.

The informant provided information about the suspect's whereabouts in Metro Manila, Philippines, which is currently at large, and a transaction that will happen today with a local gang member. They also knew the exact location of the meetup and that the suspect would have incriminating materials at the time.

As a Forensics Lab Analyst, I analyse the artefacts from crime scenes. The law enforcement agency prepared for the operation by obtaining proper search authority and assigning me as DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) First Responder to ensure the appropriate acquisition of digital artefacts and evidence for examination at the Forensics Lab, and eventually for use in litigation.

The court issued a search warrant on the same day, allowing law enforcement officers to investigate the suspect and his place of residence based on the informant's tip.
