## Project Portfolio Entry: Digital Forensics Case B4DM755

### Introduction
This project aimed to provide hands-on experience in digital forensics, focusing on evidence preservation, disk imaging, and artifact analysis. It involved a fictional case, Case B4DM755, which required participants to apply their digital forensics knowledge in a practical context.

### Project Description
The project encompassed a detailed simulation of a crime scenario involving corporate espionage and theft of trade secrets. Participants were tasked with acquiring digital artefacts and evidence for use in a court of law. The project aimed to teach the importance of proper evidence handling and the use of digital forensics tools.

### My Role
As a participant in this project, my role was that of a DFIR First Responder. I was responsible for ensuring the appropriate acquisition of digital artefacts and evidence, including creating forensic disk images, maintaining the chain of custody, and preserving the integrity of digital evidence.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- FTK Imager for disk imaging and analysis
- Write-blocking device for data protection
- Virtual machine for hands-on practice

### Challenges Faced
The project presented challenges related to time constraints, the potential tampering of evidence, and the need to accurately identify and document relevant artefacts. Additionally, the late arrival at the crime scene posed difficulties in evidence preservation.

### Solutions Implemented
To address these challenges, I followed a structured process for evidence preservation, including chain of custody procedures. I used FTK Imager to create forensic disk images, ensuring data integrity. Additionally, I documented and labelled all artefacts meticulously.

### Results and Achievements
Through this project, I gained practical experience in digital forensics, including the successful creation of forensic disk images and the proper preservation of digital evidence. This hands-on experience improved my understanding of the digital forensics process.

### Lessons Learned
I learned the importance of thorough documentation, the significance of maintaining the chain of custody, and the value of digital forensics tools like FTK Imager in preserving evidence for legal proceedings.
