# At the Scene of Crime

Unfortunately, law enforcement arrived late at the suspect's residence, where the transaction supposedly happened
because everyone appeared to have already left. There were indications of evidence eradication attempts, and a 
transaction between the nefarious elements had successfully occurred.

During a thorough search of the suspect's place, law enforcement officers discovered a flash drive under the desk.
A key chain with the initials WSM was attached to the flash drive, which the team believes belongs to the suspect.
It may have been left behind accidentally in their haste to vacate the place.

As a DFIR First Responder accompanying the Field Operatives, I
- Documented, labelled, and preserved the artefact found
- Completed the Chain of Custody form.
- Transported the artefact to the Forensics Laboratory for further examination.
